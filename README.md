Updates 2024/01/25
* del_M is more or less the same for all datasets --> TO DO (Nina): implement a function to change the value gradually from hatchling to say, puberty (or earlier) stage
* added LW datasets for Wyneken and Jones data --> TO DO: we need to check why and how these curves are so off (in different ways) and if del_M changes anything.
* f is now the same for datasets belonging to the same study (eg Jones, Wyneken) --> TO DO: improve fits
